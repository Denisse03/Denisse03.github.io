                  During my internship, I looked over various articles about
                  healthcare apps across the world. After gathering information
                  about the various healthcare apps mentioned in the articles, I
                  then look at various ways to see if they are still available
                  to be downloaded and used. The purpose of this research is to
                  figure out among the apps that are still available how they
                  are still available compared to the apps that are not
                  available to create similar apps in the future.

                  In this project I create four tasks for ten users to complete
                  in order to determine which application is user friendly. I
                  created two scripts for in person testing and virtual testing.
                  These scripts were very helpful and helped me stay on track.
                  Making sure that I do not forget or add more information in
                  one script versus another. It also helped me in order to
                  remember when I needed to ask them any questions or fill out
                  forms during the testing. In my findings it was concluded that
                  Adobe XD was more user friendly than Figma. Many users
                  struggled with completing the task with no assistance in Figma
                  than in Adobe XD. In addition many users were able to complete
                  the task more quickly in Adobe XD than in Figma.
